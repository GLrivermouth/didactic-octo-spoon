# **SpaceX  Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Prediction**

## Assignment: Exploring and Preparing Data

Estimated time needed: **70** minutes

In this assignment, we will predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is due to the fact that SpaceX can reuse the first stage.

In this lab, you will perform Exploratory Data Analysis and Feature Engineering.

Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully

Several examples of an unsuccessful landing are shown here:

![](https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-DS0701EN-SkillsNetwork/api/Images/crash.gif)

Most unsuccessful landings are planned. Space X performs a controlled landing in the oceans.

## Objectives

Perform exploratory Data Analysis and Feature Engineering using `Pandas` and `Matplotlib`

*   Exploratory Data Analysis
*   Preparing Data  Feature Engineering

### Import Libraries and Define Auxiliary Functions

We will import the following libraries the lab

#NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays
import numpy as np
# Matplotlib is a plotting library for python and pyplot gives us a MatLab like plotting framework. We will use this in our plotter function to plot data.

We can plot out the <code>FlightNumber</code> vs. <code>PayloadMass</code>and overlay the outcome of the launch. We see that as the flight number increases, the first stage is more likely to land successfully. The payload mass also appears to be a factor; even with more massive payloads, the first stage often returns successfully.

Use the function <code>catplot</code> to plot <code>FlightNumber</code> vs <code>LaunchSite</code>, set the  parameter <code>x</code>  parameter to <code>FlightNumber</code>,set the  <code>y</code> to <code>Launch Site</code> and set the parameter <code>hue</code> to <code>'class'</code>

### TASK  6: Visualize the launch success yearly trend

You can plot a line chart with x axis to be <code>Year</code> and y axis to be average success rate, to get the average launch success trend.

The function will help you get the year from the date:
